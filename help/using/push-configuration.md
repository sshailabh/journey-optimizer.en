## Get started with push configuration {#gs-push}

Before starting sending push notifications with [!DNL Journey Optimizer], you need to define settings in both [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] and [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Launch]. 

## Adobe Experience Platform settings {#platform-settings}

To set up your mobile app in [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Launch], follow these steps:

1. [Assign Property and Company rights](#push-rights)
1. [Add your mobile application's push credentials in Platform Launch](#push-credentials-launch).
1. [Create Edge configuration](#edge-configuration) to be used by **[!UICONTROL Edge]** extension to send custom data from mobile device to [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform].
1. [Set up a Platform Launch property](#launch-property).
1. [Publish the Property](#publish-property).
1. [Configure the ProfileDataSource](#configure-profiledatasource).

### Step 1: Assign Property and Company rights {#push-rights}

Before creating a mobile application, you first need to make sure that you have or assign the correct user permissions.

For more information on user management with [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Launch], refer to [Platform Launch documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/launch/using/admin/user-permissions.html#experience-cloud-permissions).

To assign Property and Company rights:

1. Access the [!DNL Admin Console].

1. From the **[!UICONTROL Products]** tab, select the **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform Launch]** card.

    ![](assets/push-config-6.png)

1. Enter a **[!UICONTROL Name]** for your new property.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Mobile]** as **[!UICONTROL Platform]**.

    ![](assets/push-config-7.png)

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]** to create your new property.

To get the SDKs needed for push notification to work you will need the following SDK extensions, for both Android and iOS:

* **[!UICONTROL Mobile Core]** (installed automatically)
* **[!UICONTROL Profile]** (installed automatically)
* **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform Edge]**
* **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform Assurance]**, optional but recommended to debug the mobile implementation.

To learn more about [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Launch] extensions, refer to [Platform Launch documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/launch-learn/implementing-in-mobile-android-apps-with-launch/configure-launch/launch-add-extensions.html).

1. Select your previously created property and select the **[!UICONTROL Extensions]** tab to view the extensions for this property.

    ![](assets/push-config-8.png)

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Configure]** under the **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform Edge]** Network' extension.

1. From the **[!UICONTROL Edge Configuration]** drop-down list, select the **[!UICONTROL Edge Configuration]** created in the previous steps. For more information on **[!UICONTROL Edge Configuration]**, refer to this [section](#edge-configuration).

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

To configure **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform Messaging]** extension to send push profile and push interactions to the correct datasets, follow the same steps as above. Use **[!UICONTROL Sandbox]**, **[!UICONTROL Event dataset]** and **[!UICONTROL  Profile Dataset]** created in the [Adobe Experience Platform setup](#edge-configuration).

### Step 5: Publish the Property {#publish-property}

You now need to publish the property to integrate your configuration and to use it in the mobile app. 
To publish your property, refer to the steps detailed in [Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK documentation](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/getting-started/create-a-mobile-property#publish-the-configuration)

### Step 6: Configure the ProfileDataSource {#configure-profiledatasource}

To configure the `ProfileDataSource`, use the `ProfileDCInletURL` from [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] setup and add the following in the mobile app:

```
    MobileCore.updateConfiguration(
    mutableMapOf("messaging.dccs" to <ProfileDCSInletURL>)
```

<!--
## Test your mobile app with custom action {#mobile-app-test}

After configuring your mobile app in both Adobe Experience Platform and Adobe Launch, you can now test it before sending push notifications to your profiles. In this use case, we will create a journey to target our mobile app and set a custom action which will trigger the push notification.

You can use a test mobile app for this use case. For more on this, refer to this [page](https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=CJM&title=Details+of+setting+the+mobile+test+app) (internal use only).
